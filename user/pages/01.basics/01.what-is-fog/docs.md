FOG (Formatting Oriented Garbage) is a Turing-complete esoteric language. The main goal of the project is to replace common (C lang) operators with formatting features exposed in the **Rich Text** file format while maintaining a standard of readability. Another key principle behind FOG is freedom from oppressive styling rules. Writing <u>Hello World</u> is as easy as pie. In fact, this document, although very inefficient, is a valid FOG "Hello World" program. A FOG implementation should read everything up to the underlined "Hello World" as a string literal. it will then process "Hello World" as another string literal, but because of the underline it will be printed to the screen. The rest of this document will be processed as another string literal. 

>>>>>> The simplest way to navigate the documentation is to use the **Next** arrow (<i class="icon-right-open"></i>) on each page. You can see your progress represented by the green progress bar at the top of the page as well as checks (<i class="icon-check"></i>) in the sidebar.  You can also star (<i class="icon-star"></i>) pages for easy reference.
