Tuples are similar to arrays, but different in function. Tuples are immutable and as such can be used as keys for other structures. They have a structure and not an order. If you want to learn more about the differences check out [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/626759/whats-the-difference-between-list-and-tuples).

> <b>3d point</b><table><tr><td>177</td></tr><tr><td>-32</td></tr><tr><td>55</td></tr></table>

Tuples are accessed in the same manner as arrays, if one wanted to print the sum of the x, y and z coordinates, they could use the following

> <u><b>3d point</b><sub>1</sub><i> + </i><b>3d point</b><sub>2</sub><i> + </i><b>3d point</b><sub>3</sub></u>
